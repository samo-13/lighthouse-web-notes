## Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime){
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
};
